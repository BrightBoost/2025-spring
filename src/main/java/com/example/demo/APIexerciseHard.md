### Creating the Student API

1. Create a class `Student` with the following attributes:
    - `id` (Long)
    - `name` (String)
    - `email` (String)
    - `age` (int)
2. Make sure that it's possible to connect with the API and that the students are stored in the database.
3. It needs to have the following options:
   - Getting all students
   - Getting a student by ID
   - Adding a student
   - (Not shown how to do this yet, see other file for detailed steps): Finding a student by name using our findByName method
